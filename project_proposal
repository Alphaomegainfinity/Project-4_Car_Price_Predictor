## Project Title: CAR PRICE PREDICTION

### Project Description/Outline:
    The aim of our project is to explore and uncover patterns in COVID-19 case data within
    Australia. Weâ€™ll examine relationships between case numbers over time, between different
    states, and compared to vaccination and hospitalisation rates.

    This will involve retrieving current and historical COVID-19 case data from websites that
    report it, listed below under data sources. This data will be stored in an SQL database,
    cleaned and organised as necessary, then visualised. The nature of COVID-19 reporting
    means that the visualisations produced will be live, meaning that they will be updated
    automatically.
