### Purpose of the assignment

    The aim of our project is to explore and predict the car price based on the model that we use the machine learning model to train based on the existing data. Weâ€™ll examine relationships between difference between the actual price and the predicted price.

    This will involve retrieving existing car price from Kaggle 
    automatically.

### Data sources:

    -https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?datasetId=33080&sortBy=dateCreated
    
</br>

### Process of the project

1. car_price_predictor.ipynb: we scrape the websites and retrieve the database then we clean the dataset
1. Checking the relationship between selling price and other factors (engine type, km driven, owner type, selling type, mileage....)
